Description: This package provides a set of tools for calculating input-output matrices 
  from a commodity–industry accounting system. The methodology in this functions
  follows the Miller and Blair's approach 
  (Miller, Ronald E., and Peter D. Blair. Input-output analysis: foundations and extensions. Cambridge university press, 2009) 
  in accordance with the System of National Accounts (SNA). There are two approaches here using the 
  Use and Make matrices. 1) The Commodity-Demand Driven Model (using "Industry-Based" Technology or "Commodity-Base" Technology) 
  and 2) Industry-Demand Driven Model (using "Industry-Based" Technology or "Commodity-Base" Technology). 
  The Technology (A) and Total Requirement Matrices (Z) obtained here can be Commodity-by-Commodity or Industry-by-Industry. 
  For more information on the calculation methodology, see Miller and Blair's Chapter 5 (2009).
